    <p>After a series of scandals, Sigma, the world’s largest tech company, has attracted significant public backlash. In response, the company has publicly committed itself to adopting a greater focus on social responsibility and ethics. As an experienced and well-respected software engineering manager at Sigma, you have been chosen to serve as Director the company's newly formed Responsible Innovation Team. Your first assignment in this role is to provide input on some new developments from within Sigma's autonomous vehicle (AV) division.</p>

    <p>Sigma is in the process of designing its Model Z, which the VP of the AV division says will be the most advanced car ever introduced on the market. One of the biggest enhancements from the previous model involves its automated driving system, RoboDrive. RoboDrive can be used to fully automate driving functions (i.e., steering and speed control) in certain settings. It  relies a network of 12 installed 2D cameras that provide a 360 degree field of vision and a deep neural network that turns sensory input into vehicle control output. Previously, RoboDrive was only intended for driving in highway settings. However, Sigma is now looking to take a massive leap forward with the Model Z by extending the RoboDrive feature for use in urban areas with heavy vehicle and foot traffic. Drivers will still need to remain alert and prepared to take back control of the vehicle at any moment, but the Model Z's RoboDrive will enable them to automate a much greater share of their daily commutes.</p>
        
    <p>The VP of the AV division tells you one of the biggest challenges facing their team is RoboDrive's recognition of pedestrians, especially under conditions of limited or poor visibility. However, they assure you that the system's pedestrian recognition will improve over time as the underlying neural net is trained on more data. In fact, it just so happens that a relatively unfortunate incident involving a competitor has presented Sigma with a major opportunity. The world's largest smartphone maker, Banana, recently suffered a historic data breach involving its cloud backup service and the hackers proceeded to dump billions of user images onto the Internet. The current plan is to utilize this massive publicly accessible photo library—posted without any accompanying metadata for identifying an images' source—to help train the neural net and rapidly improve RoboDrive's ability to identify pedestrians. As for the limitations in dealing with limited visibility, the VP of the AV division suggests it should be obvious to drivers that RoboDrive should not be used during foggy/inclement weather or at nighttime. She explains that this is because it is widely known that the system relies solely on 2D camera vision which, unlike other sensing technologies (e.g., Radar, LIDAR), is poorly suited for operating in such conditions. In other words, passengers should know better than to activate the RoboDrive feature when there is poor visibility.

    <p>Finally, the other big challenge facing the AV division is that data they collected indicates many drivers are reluctant to begin consistently using the RoboDrive feature because they do not fully trust it. Despite being demonstrably safer than a human driver, the VP of the AV division suspects this distrust of RoboDrive has a lot to do with the way operates the vehicle, as it can feel unnatural to passengers who are not used to it. She wants to try experimenting with various small changes that may help drivers feel more comfortable using the feature. In order to do so, they are planning a joint testing program with Sigma's ridesharing division. Through this program, random users of Sigma's ridesharing app will be picked up in different variants of the early stage Model Z. Some of these Model Zs will be equipped with experimental tweaks to RoboDrive intended to offer a smoother riding experience. Although there will be a human driver that appears to be operating the vehicle, the RoboDrive feature—unbeknownst to passengers at the time—will be active for most of the trip. Different cameras capturing passenger facial expressions and state-of-the-art wireless sensors capturing their vital signs (e.g,. breathing and heart rates) will be installed in the car. This data will then be used to detect whether otherwise unsuspecting passengers become alerted to anything unusual about the ride. This, in turn, will help determine which experimental features (and to what extent) help provide an experience that feels natural to passengers, so much so they are unable to distinguish it from that of a human driver.</p>

    <p>Your task is to prepare a brief report (4-6 pages double spaced) containing your thoughts on the AV division's current plans. Should they proceed with the Model Z or do you have reservations? Are there aspects that could prove controversial from an ethical standpoint or expose Sigma to significant legal risk? Do you recommend any changes, additional measures, or removal of problematic features in order to make its plans more acceptable?</p>
