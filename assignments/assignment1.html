    <p>As an experienced and well-respected software engineering manager at Sigma, the world’s largest social media platform, you have been chosen to lead the company’s newly formed Responsible Innovation Team. You receive an email from your boss, Sigma CEO Geoff Bozos, requesting your input on a major new project the company has been working on.</p>
    <p> Sigma has been developing DeepStudio, a new AI-powered visual content creation suite that allows users to generate complex, realistic videos from user-supplied natural language descriptions. DeepStudio will be built on top of a massive, transformer-based machine learning model that Sigma is planning to train. Using DeepStudio, a user will enters a few sentences into a prompt and, a few minutes later, it will return a video depicting life-like human subjects, breathtaking natural landscapes, or just about anything else you could possibly imagine. The DeepStudio suite comes equipped with several tools that can then be used to edit, fine-tune, or transform generated content. For example, users can leverage a feature that enables them to string together several generated clips to create much longer and more complex video sequences. Bozos believes this technology will help unlock humanity’s full creative potential; no longer will the ability to create brilliant pieces of visual storytelling be limited to those with multi-million dollar budgets and decades of experience.</p>
    <p>Having been embroiled in a number of recent scandals, the company has publicly committed itself to adopt a greater focus on social responsibility and ethics. In his email, Bozos asks the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If and/or under what conditions it is acceptable to use videos and photographs uploaded by users of Sigma’s main social media platform for training the underlying neural network that powers DeepStudio.</li>
        <li>Whether there are concerns with the DeepStudio team’s plan to test how realistic the videos are by displaying them, disguised as actual news stories, on the news feeds of a small number of randomly selected users and measuring their responses.</li>
        <li>Finally, whether you think Sigma should proceed with DeepStudio, and if so, whether there are any changes you would recommend. Bozos notes that the legal team is already looking into the potential copyright issues presented by DeepStudio, so there is no need to focus on those for now.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Instructions</h5>
