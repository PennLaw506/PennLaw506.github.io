        Geoff Bozos was very impressed with the guidance you provided on DeepStudio. Having won his trust and respect, he is now asking for your input on another ambitious new venture that Sigma has in the works. This time, it is the development of SigmaPay, a mobile payments service that enables NFC-based contactless purchases and peer-to-peer money transactions all via smart phone. However, Bozos assures you that this is much more than any old payments app. It will incorporate many exciting new social features that distinguish it from competing services.

        Part of what makes SigmaPay unique is that users earn points with every transaction they make, as well as by meeting daily and weekly goals. Accumulating enough points allows a user to "level-up" and earn in-app prizes. SigmaPay will also be fully integrated into Sigma’s main social media platform. When users join SigmaPay by signing in with their primary Sigma account,  they will automatically be connected with their friends from the social media side. Moreover, the points earned by a user's friends are displayed on a leaderboard, enabling friends to compete against each other. Users finishing atop the leaderboard at the end of a period can win discounts to major online retailers as well as special badges that are displayed on their profiles, giving them a chance to show off their bragging rights.

    To make things even more competitive, users have the ability to purchase SigmaPay "boosts". These are bonus multipliers applied to all of a user’s transactions for a limited, allowing them to earn anywhere from two to five times as many points. However, Sigma also recognizes that many users simply do not have the disposable income to justify purchasing these boosts. If a large share of the potential user base gets the perception that they will never be competitive in SigmaPay because it is effectively “pay-to-win”, the app’s adoption will be significantly hampered. This is why Sigma is planning to enable “bonus periods” that occur randomly several times a week. When a bonus period is triggered, the app will notify all users that purchases within a two-hour window will be boosted by a multiplier. Hence, can still be competitive simply by making timely purchases.

        Part of the reason Bozos is so excited about the SigmaPay idea is that it provides the company with multiple different revenue streams. In addition to the money it makes from in-app purchases, participating banks have agreed to give Sigma a very small cut (0.15%) of every merchant transaction initiated by a user through SigmaPay. Additionally, this new service will help enhance the value of Sigma’s already-lucrative personalized ad business. As stated in the SigmaPay privacy policy, every time a purchase is made using SigmaPay, the following information is transmitted to Sigma’s servers:
        <ul>
            <li>User name;</li>
            <li>Account identifier;</li>
            <li>Purchase amount;</li>
            <li>Vendor name;</li>
            <li>User geolocation; and</li>
            <li>Timestamp.</li>
        </ul>
        Upon collection, the transaction data generated by SigmaPay users flows directly into a massive enterprise data warehouse containing user data from all of Sigma’s other platforms. Combining all of this data together—linking a person’s online identity to their real-world purchase history—will enable Sigma to generate extremely detailed profiles about a user's predicted buying behavior. These insights can then be leveraged to provide highly effective, personalized ad-targeting services that third-party product sellers will be lining up to pay for. 
    </p>

    Finally, SigmaPay transaction data is also replicated and stored in a separate analytical database. Sigma then charges large market research firms a subscription fee for the ability to query this database in order to study more general consumer buying trends. However, Bezos assures you that this should have little impact on user privacy since the user name and account identifier fields are excluded from this analytical database.

        Having gained a little bit of goodwill from the public after its latest DeepStudio announcement, which many saw as a promising sign that Sigma was indeed beginning to prioritize ethics and social responsibility, Bozos wants to continue in this direction. He wants to know whether you have any reservations about the plan. Are there any aspects that could prove controversial or lead to legal troubles? Should they proceed with the existing proposal? If not, are there any recommended design changes, additional measures to be taken, or problematic features to be removed that would make SigmaPay more acceptable?
