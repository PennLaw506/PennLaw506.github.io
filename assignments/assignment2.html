        Geoff Bozos was very impressed with the guidance you provided on DeepStudio. Having won his trust and respect, he is now asking for your input on another Sigma project under development. Bozos says Sigma is currently planning its most ambitious endeavour yet. The plan is to emulate WeChat and evolve Sigma into the American "everything app", with messaging, social media, mobile payments, and a digital marketplace all in one spot. This includes the introduction of two new services: SigmaPay and the Sigma Marketplace.

        SigmaPay is a mobile payments service that enables NFC-based contactless purchases and peer-to-peer money transactions all via smart phone. However, Bozos says it is much more than that, as it will incorporate many exciting new social features that will distinguish it from competing services. Part of what makes SigmaPay unique is that users earn points with every transaction they make, as well as by meeting daily and weekly goals. Accumulating enough points allows a user to "level-up" and earn in-app prizes. SigmaPay will also be fully integrated into Sigma’s main social media platform, so users of the service will automatically be connected with their Sigma friends. Moreover, the points earned by a user's friends are displayed on a leaderboard, enabling friends to compete against each other. Users finishing atop the leaderboard at the end of a period are awarded special badges displayed on their profiles, giving them chance to show off their bragging rights. To make things even more competitive, users have the ability to purchase SigmaPay "boosts". These are bonus multipliers applied to all of a users transactions during a certain time window, allowing them to earn anywhere from two to five times as many points.

        Part of the reason Bozos is so excited about the SigmaPay idea is that it provides the company with multiple different revenue streams. In addition to in-app purchases, participating banks have agreed to give Sigma a very small cut (0.15%) of every transaction that a user makes. Additionally, as stated in its privacy policy, every time a purchase is made using SigmaPay, the following information is transmitted to Sigma’s servers: purchase amount, vendor name, user geolocation and timestamp. All of this information is aggregated in a giant database which Sigma will charge large market research firms to query in order to study consumer buying trends. He assures you that this should have little impact on user privacy since the user name and account identifier are not included in the data set.

        The other major component of the plan is the creation of Sigma Marketplace. Unlike big e-commerce platforms which tend to favor larger sellers, Sigma Marketplace provides a chance for small businesses and sole proprietors. Any Sigma user who wants to list something for sale on the Marketplace can do so in just a few clicks. Bozos said he is not worried about spam, fraud, or malicious listings and does not plan on hiring additional content moderators. Instead, they plan on implementing an upvote/downvote system that will naturally lead to low-quality listings being hidden.

        Having gained a little bit of goodwill from the public after its latest DeepStudio announcement, which many saw as a promising sign that Sigma was indeed beginning to prioritize ethics and social responsibility, Bozos wants to continue in this direction. He wants to know whether you have any reservations about the plan. Are there any aspects of the plan that could prove controversial or lead to legal troubles? Should they proceed with the existing proposal? If not, are there any recommended design changes, additional measures to be taken, or problematic features to be removed that would make SigmaPay more acceptable?
