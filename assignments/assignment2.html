        The CEO of Beta was impressed with the guidance you provided on the EV Division's proposed Model L7. Having won their trust and respect, you are now being asked to provide input on another Beta project under development. You are told Beta is currently planning its most ambitious endeavour yet. The plan is to emulate China's popular WeChat and evolve Beta into the American "everything app", with messaging, social media, mobile payments, ridesharing, and an e-commerce platform all in one place. This includes the introduction of two new services: BetaPay and the Beta Marketplace.

        BetaPay is a mobile payments service that enables NFC-based contactless purchases and peer-to-peer money transactions all via smart phone. Perhaps more importantly, it will incorporate many exciting new social features that will distinguish it from competing services. Part of what makes BetaPay unique is that users earn points with every transaction they make, as well as by meeting daily and weekly goals. Accumulating enough points allows a user to "level-up" and earn in-app prizes. BetaPay will also be fully integrated into Beta’s main social media platform, so users of the service will automatically be connected with their Beta friends. Moreover, the points earned by a user's friends are displayed on a leaderboard, enabling friends to compete against each other. Users finishing atop the leaderboard at the end of a period are awarded special badges displayed on their profiles, giving them chance to show off their bragging rights. To make things even more competitive, users have the ability to purchase "boosts". These are bonus multipliers applied to all of a users transactions during a certain time window, allowing them to earn anywhere from two to five times as many points.

        The other major component of the plan is the creation of Beta Marketplace. Unlike big e-commerce platforms which tend to favor larger sellers, Beta Marketplace provides an opportunity for small businesses and sole proprietors to flourish. Any Beta user who wants to list something for sale on the Marketplace can do so in just a few clicks. Beta's CEO says the company is not worried about spam, fraud, or malicious listings because they plan on implementing an upvote/downvote system that will naturally lead to low-quality listings being hidden.

        Part of the reason Beta is so excited about this plan is because it provides the company with several different revenue streams. First, BetaPay not only earns revenue through in-app purchases (e.g., boosts), but participating banks have agreed to give Beta a very small cut (0.15%) of every transaction that a user makes using BetaPay. Next, as stated in the privacy policy that users must agree to during the sign-up process, every time a purchase is made using BetaPay, the following information is transmitted to Beta's servers: universal Beta account identifier, purchase amount, vendor name, user geolocation, and timestamp. This information is used to create a giant dataset that Beta will charge large market research firms to query in order to study consumer trends. Beta's CEO assures you that this should have little impact on user privacy since they anonymized the dataset by first removing the account identifier field. Finally, the transaction data captured from BetaPay also flows into a massive enterprise data warehouse that contains user data from all of Beta's other platforms. Combining all of this data enables Beta to generate extremely detailed profiles about a user's predicted buying behavior. Beta uses these profiles to display highly targeted advertisements containing products listed on the Beta Marketplace. Since Beta takes a small cut out of all purchases on the Marketplace, it directly benefits from inducing a sale.

        Following the internal announcement of major changes being made to Beta's Model L7, something many within the company saw as a promising sign that it was indeed beginning to prioritize ethics and social responsibility, Beta execs want to continue in this direction. You are asked whether you have any reservations about the plan. Are there any aspects that could prove controversial or lead to legal troubles? Should they proceed with the existing proposals? If not, are there any recommended design changes, additional measures to be taken, or problematic features to be removed that would make either BetaPay or the Beta Marketplace more acceptable?
