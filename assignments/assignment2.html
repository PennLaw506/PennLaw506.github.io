        Marc Sugarmountain was very impressed with the guidance you provided on DeepStudio. Having won his trust and respect, he is now asking for your input on another Anthro project under development. Anthro is currently planning on making a grand entrance into the world of FinTech with a new product called AnthroPay. On its surface, AnthroPay looks like yet another mobile payments service that enables NFC-based contactless purchases and peer-to-peer money transactions all via smart phone. However, Sugarmountain says it is so much more than that.

        AnthroPay will incorporate many exciting new social features that will distinguish it from competing services. First, users will generate points from their purchases made using AnthroPay. These points can be used to earn rewards by meeting daily and weekly goals. Such rewards include credits or discounts towards purchases at participating vendors. The app will also give users the option to connect with their friends from Anthro’s main social media platform, allowing them to compete against each other for in-app prizes. Those at the top of the friend leaderboard at the end of a period will be awarded special badges that are displayed on their profiles, giving winners the chance to show off their bragging rights. Users who do not possess the means to spend as much can still be competitive by making timely purchases during special “bonus periods”. During these randomly occurring periods, the app will notify users that purchases within the specified time window will be boosted by a bonus multiplier, allowing them to earn anywhere from two to five times as many points.

        The best part, according to Sugarmoutain, is that all of this is free for users because Anthro generates its revenue elsewhere. First, participating banks have agreed to give Anthro a very small cut (0.15%) of every transaction. Second, businesses will pay Anthro to offer special targeted promotions to users based on their purchase history. As stated in its privacy policy, every time a purchase is made, the following information is transmitted to Anthro’s servers: user account ID, purchase amount, vendor name, user geolocation and timestamp. It then uses a classification algorithm to identify users who are most likely to take advantage of a given promotion and displays it to them in the AnthroPay app accordingly. Finally, Anthro will charge large market research firms for access to aggregated transaction data so they can use it to study consumer buying trends. He assures you that this should impact user privacy since Anthro will be removing the user account identifier from the datasets before they are shared.

        Having gained a little bit of goodwill from the public after its latest DeepStudio announcement, which many saw as a promising sign that Anthro was indeed beginning to prioritize ethics and social responsibility, Sugarmountain wants to continue in this direction. He wants to know whether you have any reservations about AnthroPay or see aspects of it that could prove controversial. Should they proceed with the existing proposal? If not, are there any recommended design changes, additional measures to be taken, or problematic features to be removed that would make AnthroPay more acceptable?
