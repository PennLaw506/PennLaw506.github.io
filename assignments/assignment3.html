    <p>One of the downsides of running this course on such a tight schedule--covering a lot of material in a short amount of time--is that we left a lot of great discussion on the table. I recall multiple occasions this semester where one of you posed an interesting question relevant to that day's topic and I said something like, "we could probably spend a whole day on that alone" before moving us along. Well, now is your chance to explore some of these questions further, as the topic of the third short writing assignment will be one of your own choosing.</p>

    <p>The guidelines for this assignment are fairly simple. Select a topic relevant to the course that we did not have an opportunity to discuss in depth during class. This can either be:
        <ul>
            <li>A legal question presented by a new or emerging technology - What are the important/relevant parts of the question? What are some potential solutions that have been floated out there? How do you recommend regulators/policymakers/judges should proceed?</li>
            <li>An ethical issue posed by a new or emerging technology - What makes it ethically significant and how should tech professionals and companies think about/act on it? As always, you are encouraged to incorporate frameworks/principles we have been dealing with all semester.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The instructions regarding length, format, sources, etc. are the same as with the previous two assignment. All that I ask you do differently is to send me an email, sometime within a week or so of the due date, informing me of the topic you intend to write about. This is mostly for your benefit, as it will allow me to steer you in the right direction and suggest resources that could be useful in developing your paper.</p>
